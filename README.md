## ASSINGMENT 2

## Edited Files:
-search.py Where all of your search algorithms will reside.

-searchAgents.py Where all of your search-based agents will reside.

### Files you should go through:
-pacman.py The main file that runs Pacman games. This file describes a Pacman GameState type, which you use in this project.

-game.py The logic behind how the Pacman world works. This file describes several supporting types like AgentState, Agent, Direction, and Grid.

-util.py Useful data structures for implementing search algorithms.

## ASSINGMENT 3

### Edited Files:
valueIterationAgents.py: A value iteration agent for solving known MDPs.

qlearningAgents.py: Q-learning agents for Gridworld, Crawler and Pacman.

analysis.py: A file to put your answers to questions given in the project.

### Files you should go through:
mdp.py: Defines methods on general MDPs.

learningAgents.py: Defines the base classes ValueEstimationAgent and QLearningAgent, which your agents will extend.

util.py: Utilities, including util.Counter, which is particularly useful for Q-learners.

gridworld.py: The Gridworld implementation.

featureExtractors.py: Classes for extracting features on (state,action) pairs. Used for the approximate Q-learning agent (in qlearningAgents.py).
